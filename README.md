This web application was deployed on netlify. [Here](https://work-hard-play-harder-akm-webp.netlify.app/) is the link to the deployed webapp.

This was a part of [Crio's Winter of Doing program](https://www.crio.do/crio-winter-of-doing/).
It is integrated with my github account (using a generated github token). This helps in getting the titles and decriptions of my repositories displayed.
It is also integrated with a backend (and a database) deployed on heroku.
Check out out the page to find out more.
