This web application was deployed on Netlify. [Here](https://work-hard-play-harder-akm-webp.netlify.app/) is the link to the deployed web app.

This was a part of [Crio's Winter of Doing program](https://www.crio.do/crio-winter-of-doing/).
It is integrated with my GitHub account (using a generated GitHub token). This helps in getting the titles and descriptions of my repositories displayed.
It is also integrated with a backend (and a database) deployed on Heroku.
Check out out the page to find out more.
